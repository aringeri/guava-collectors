# guava-collectors
This is a simple library to provide Java 8 collectors for some collection types from the [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) library.
This library intends to provide collectors that are lacking in Guava 20 (and below). The coming release of Guava 21.0 will will likely provide the collectors defined in this library.
